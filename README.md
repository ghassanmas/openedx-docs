Testing different ways of handeling Open edX docs 

This repo is for testing purpose regarding handeling i18n of the Open edX docs. 

Please note the content is mostly being pulled/copied from https://github.com/openedx/edx-documentation. While making a fork would be possible, I have ran into many issues since since the repo has a sophistaced structure as a sphinx project. And since the structure of doc is not a concern of testing, I chose to start with fresh repo.
