To upload a video to a third party hosting site, follow the instructions for
that site. Keep the following guidelines in mind.

.. only:: Open_edX

 * If you host your videos on `YouTube`_, you must follow all rules and
   restrictions that are associated with YouTube.

* The URL for the video that you upload on a third party hosting site must end
  in .mp4, .mpeg, .webm, or .ogg. The video player cannot support videos that
  you upload on sites such as Vimeo, Dailymotion, or other sites that use their
  own player.

  To help make sure all standard browsers can play your video, edX strongly
  recommends that you use .mp4 format.

  The video URL might resemble the following example.

  ``https://s3.amazonaws.com/edx-course-videos/edx-edx101/EDXSPCPJSP13-G030300.mp4``

* If you have copies of a video in multiple resolutions, you must upload each
  copy to the hosting site. For more information, see :ref:`Video Guidelines`.

* After you upload a video on a hosting site, you must make sure you have the
  URL for that copy of the video. If you upload copies of your video on more
  than one hosting site, make sure you have the URL for each video location.

For more information about hosting your videos, see :ref:`Set Up a Hosting
Service`.
