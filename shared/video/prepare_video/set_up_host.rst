   .. note::
    For courses on edx.org, you do not have to set up a hosting service to
    store your videos. You can skip to :ref:`Create a Video`.

    For Edge courses, you must work with a third party hosting site to make
    your videos available for streaming or download.

    To host your videos, you can use any video hosting site that you want. Many
    courses use `Amazon S3`_. When you select a video hosting site, we strongly
    recommend that you keep the following information in mind.

   You must work with a third party hosting site to make your videos available
   for streaming or download.

   To host your videos, you can use any video hosting site that you want, such
   as `Amazon S3`_ or `YouTube`_.

   When you select a video hosting site, we strongly recommend that you keep
   the following information in mind.

.. only:: Open_edX

 * If you host your videos on `YouTube`_, you must follow all rules and
   restrictions that are associated with YouTube.

* The hosting site might have to handle high traffic volume.
* Not all hosting sites are available in all countries or regions. We recommend
  that you upload videos to more than one hosting site.
* Learners' internet connections vary widely. We recommend that you make your
  videos available for both download and streaming.
* The URL for your videos must end in .mp4, .mpeg, .webm, or .ogg. The video
  player cannot support videos that you upload on sites such as Vimeo,
  Dailymotion, or other sites that use their own player.

  .. note::
    To help make sure all standard browsers can play your video, we strongly
    recommend that you use .mp4 format.
