The Learner View of Grades
**************************

After a grading policy is in place, learners can view both their problem scores
and the percent completed and current grade on the **Progress** page for the
course.

.. note::
  If you have hidden the problem results for some assignments, these scores are
  not visible on the **Progress** page. The page shows only that the learner
  has completed the assignment. For more information about hiding problem
  results, see :ref:`Problem Results Visibility`.

Each item in the X axis of the chart is for a graded subsection. Graded
problems in units are not broken out in the chart; the score from each problem
in the subsection is added to that vertical bar.

Graded subsections are grouped in the chart by assignment type rather than
listed in chronological order. For example, all homework exercises are grouped
together, followed by labs, then exams.

.. note::
 The **x** for an assignment in the Progress tab indicates that the grade for
 that assignment is currently dropped. You configure how many assignments are
 dropped when you :ref:`configure assignment types <Configure the Assignment
 Types>`.
