You can set a grace period that extends homework due dates for your learners.
The grace period applies to the whole course; you cannot set different grace
periods for individual assignments.

.. note::
  The grace period setting does not apply to the following assignments and
  exams.

  * Timed exams. For more information, see :ref:`Grant Learners More Time for a
    Timed Exam`.
  * Proctored exams.
  * Open response assessments. For information about setting the response date
    for an ORA assignment, see :ref:`Specify Assignment Names and Dates <PA
