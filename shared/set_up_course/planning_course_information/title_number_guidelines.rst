* Limit the course name to 70 characters. Many of the most effective
  course titles have 50 or fewer characters.
* If the course is part of a sequence, create a title that includes both
  sequence and course information, formatted as "Sequence: Course".
* Select a course title that clearly indicates the course subject matter.
* Make sure the course title follows search engine optimization (SEO)
  guidelines.
* Make sure the course title targets a global audience.
