Managing Discussions
##########################

Course discussions foster interaction among learners and between learners and
the course team. You can set up different topics to guide these interactions
when you create your course, and then run and moderate discussions throughout
the course to encourage participation and develop course community. Discussions
are also excellent sources of feedback and ideas for future courses or course
runs.

Use the topics in this section to learn about managing course discussions,
including creating discussion topics, running discussions in a live course,
choosing to divide topics based on learner groups, building a team of
discussion moderators, and moderating discussions.

.. note:: Some features of discussions, especially moderation features, are
   not available when discussions are accessed in the edX mobile app. For
   information about the differences between discussions on the edx.org site
   and in the mobile app, see :ref:`Discussions on Mobile Apps`.
